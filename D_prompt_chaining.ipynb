      "\n",
      "### 6.1 Data Privacy & Governance  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Fragmented regulations:** While the **PDPB** is slated for 2025, many states still rely on legacy IT (Information Technology Act, 2000) provisions.  \n",
      "- **Consent fatigue:** Users often click “Agree” without understanding AI’s data usage, leading to potential **non‑compliance**.  \n",
      "- **Solution pathways:** Adopt **privacy‑enhancing technologies** (differential privacy, federated learning) and **standardise consent UI** across sectors.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 6.2 Talent Gap at Advanced Levels  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Senior AI researchers:** ~1,200 PhDs in AI across the country (2024), a stark contrast to the US (≈ 12,000).  \n",
      "- **Brain‑drain vs. reverse‑brain‑drain:** While the diaspora is returning as founders, **mid‑career talent** still migrates for higher R&D salaries.  \n",
      "- **Mitigation:** Increase **government‑funded PhD fellowships**, create **“AI research tenure tracks”** in private labs, and introduce **tax incentives** for corporate R&D hiring.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 6.3 Infrastructure Bottlenecks  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Compute scarcity:** Tier‑2 and Tier‑3 cities have limited access to **GPU clusters**; reliance on foreign cloud providers (AWS, Azure) raises **data‑sovereignty** concerns.  \n",
      "- **Domestic cloud push:** **JioCloud**, **NxtGen**, and **CtrlS** are building **AI‑optimised zones** (NVMe SSD, 8‑core GPUs), but adoption remains low.  \n",
      "- **Policy lever:** Offer **subsidised compute credits** for startups working on national priority AI problems (e.g., agritech).  \n",

      "| **Algorithmic bias** | Credit‑scoring models under‑weight borrowers from certain PIN codes. | Exclusion of marginalized communities, regulatory fines. |\n",
      "| **Job displacement** | Automation of low‑skill warehouse jobs. | Short‑term unemployment, need for reskilling. |\n",
      "| **Deep‑fake misuse** | Synthetic political videos spread during elections. | Threat to democratic processes, misinformation. |\n",

      "**Recommendations:** Mandate **bias audits** before model deployment, create **AI‑upskilling programmes** for displaced workers, and enforce **deep‑fake detection standards** (e.g., mandatory watermarking).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 6.5 Regulatory Uncertainty  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Over‑regulation risk:** A **one‑size‑fits‑all AI Act** could stifle innovation, especially for SMEs.  \n",
      "- **Standardisation lag:** ISO/IEC 22989 (AI concepts) and 23053 (AI governance) are still being adopted by Indian firms.  \n",
      "- **Way forward:** Implement **sector‑specific sandboxes** (e.g., fintech, health) that allow **controlled experimentation** under regulator supervision.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 6.6 Funding Gaps for Early‑Stage Deep‑Tech  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Patient capital shortage:** Most VC funds prefer **product‑market fit** over **long‑horizon research**.  \n",
      "- **Consequences:** Deep‑tech startups often **pivot** to SaaS‑lite solutions rather than pursuing breakthrough AI hardware or novel algorithms.  \n",
